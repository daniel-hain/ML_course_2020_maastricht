```{r setup, include=FALSE}
### Generic preamble
rm(list=ls())
Sys.setenv(LANG = "en") # For english language
options(scipen = 5) # To deactivate annoying scientific number notation
set.seed(1337) # To have a seed defined for reproducability

### Knitr options
library(knitr) # For display of the markdown
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE,
                     message=FALSE,
                     fig.align="center"

# About me

# What we did so far

## Summing up

1. Understand the core ideas behind ML & predictive modeling
2. Understand how we fit predictive models
3. Understand ML workflows
4. Understand how to establish generalization in ML models

## Today we will

1. Reflext on the exercises so far.
2. Look into another case (tech & NLP)
3. Have some own exercises

# Q0: What questions came up so far?

# Q1: How can ML methods be useful for Policy Analysis?

# Q2: How will ML & AI methods impact

# Q3: What cases/tasks are appropriate for using ML models?
